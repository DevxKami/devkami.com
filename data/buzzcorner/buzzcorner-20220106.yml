    \ paper does note that it is possible to impact compute bound tasks by extending\
    \ the ghOSt policy with similar logic to what Linux\u2019s CFS contains around\
    \ nice values. . What stood out to me the most about this section is actually\
    \ ghOSt\u2019s impact on developer productivity: When developing a kernel scheduler,\
    \ the write-test-write cycle includes (a) compiling a kernel (up to 15 minutes),\
    \ (b) deploying the kernel (10-20 minutes), and (c) running the test (1 hour due\
    \ to database initialization following a reboot)."
