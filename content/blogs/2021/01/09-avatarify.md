Recently I discovered a thing called [First Order Motion Model](https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/first-order-model). This is a technique to create deepfakes using a driver video and one image. It have a few interesting use, other than deepfake. One particular one is testing clothes. 

But today I am doing something more mischievous. I am doing this to pretend to be someone on webcam in a chat. The way I do this is [Avatarify](https://github.com/alievk/avatarify#linux). This is an application running on a computer that create a virtual webcam for you to pretend as someone else. In this case I pretend to be Einstein and Mona Lisa.

The setup step on the page just works for me on linux running on a GTX1060. It requires you to install Anaconda to work. One very interesting scenario is the use of Google Colab to drive the image. I didn't try it, it worth to do so if you don't have a powerful graphics cards. 

Arguably using a real human face is a little evil. But you can use use paintings for [example](https://www.reddit.com/r/MotionDesign/comments/j61scc/r_first_order_motion_model_applied_to_animate/). I can foresee many fun we can use for this. One day even animate cartoon or anime characters. Just don't evil.
