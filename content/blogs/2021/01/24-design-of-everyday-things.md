I got this book for a while. This is one of those classic books on design. While the book have a focus on industrial design. The new version of the books also covers UI design now. 

The books covers the psychology of people using a device. What make a device easy to use, why it doesn't. More importantly why everything is design to be easy to use, spoiler it is not just because of engineering. 

One important take away for this book is, often when a device is hard to use, it is not the users fault. But you don't always get to change it even when you find an easier way. But sometime you do, so it is worth doing.
