I got this book not too long ago. The book is about design of common things enhanced by embedded devices, or common called in our circle IoT device. This is a more high level book than a technical one, but it have very good insights on how to make an IoT devices. 

The book only covers briefly on tablets and devices with screens. The focus is on common device enhanced by embedded computers, or as author says Enchanted Objects. The idea being an common object like pill bottles, salt shakers etc, with magical power but do not need special knowledge to use. 

One of the insight of this book is how such an enchanted objects should work. That is:- 

* It need to be glanceable.
* Gestureable, 
* Affordable.
* Wearable
* Indestructable
* Usable
* Lovable

In the book the author also states that technology is already available. Which to some is a high level statement. But if the reason(such as yours truly) have experience with Arduino and the like, one can be inspired on what can be achieved. 

The author also present his vision on how these enchanted can improve the world, he also shows actual product that some of us is familiar with as examples. One can feel inspired, even though I don't agree with some of the vision. 

This is a book is for designer that want to know about design outside of screens, hardware hackers that want an idea how to make something, or anyone that is interested in a product. I don't agree with the social aspect of the book, but i still think it is a good read.
