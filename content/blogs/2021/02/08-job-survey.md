Recently I have done a Malaysian Software Developer survey. The goal is to see the type of tools and practices used by the local software developers. In the survey, it covers IDE, Programming Languages, test practices, etc. 
                                                                                                     
We have gathered 90+ submissions. It is not the most comprehensive. As one can see, our submission is biased toward Android dev on the mobile side, not many .NET and Java developer, only one submission to embedded software developers. There's duplicate of the category as well. But for the first time we are doing this, it is not bad.

We hope to do one more in 2022. One improvement that I can think of is, we may add roles in the questionaire. We hope to improve the way we ask the question on application and tools, as we can't get a good breakdown of tools and relationship with application type. We also accept more ideas, you can find us in our socials and our slack channel at https://engineersmy.slack.com/.
